version 4.0-6


1. pvc() : has been modified to allow fixing the dfs when the "by" argument   is a factor (Tim Cole suggest it).

2. 

version 4.0.3

1. stepGAIC.VR(): has been modified so if one or more models
     failed to fit the function still continue with the
     step wise algorithm.
2. stepGAICAll() is renamed now stepGAICAll.A() for strategy A.
      Other strategies will follow.
3. update.gamlss() now the argument 'what' takes also the value
   "All". Note that 'what' is relevant only if the argument
   'formula.' is set.

4. stepGAICAll.B() is introduced. Strategy B fits the relevant
        term in all the distribution parameters.

5. centiles.fan() is introduce for fan-chart of the centiles.

6. centiles() has an extra option "points" on whether to
         include the points in the plot or not

7. the package gamlss.data now includes a help file for the
          data.frame acidity. 

version 4.0.0

1. pb(): if set the degrees of freedom are allowed to be below 1

2. BEINF0 and BEINF1 are added in gamlss.dist

3. gamlss() is amended to use the same environment when it
     changes the formula in "mcall". This is to correct a problem
     when gamlss is called from other functions (reported by Dr
     Willem Vervoort)

4. stepGAICAll() is introduced in the gamlss package for
      the selection of terms in all the parameters

5. add1.gamlss() and drop1.gamlss() are added to complement
       addterm.gamlss() and dropterm.gamlss() (which required
       MASS)

6. LR.test(): The likelihood ratio test function for nested GAMLSS
           models is introduced.

7. PO, NBI, NBII, PIG, ZIP, ZIP2m DEL are retested and
   modified

8. gamlss.tr: the definition of right truncation in discrete
     distributions has changed. For example right truncation
     at 14, excludes 14 as possible value.

9. stepTGD() is introduce for selection of terms using a test
             data set.

10. centiles.com() "main" is added as argument


11. gamlssNP() the function has being modified by Michael Höhle
    to correct  for situations where the likelihood calculation
    produced NA's.

12. In some of the examples used in the help files of gamlss
    the function cs() has change to pb() to emphasize the fact
    that the degrees of freedom for the smoother are now
    estimated.

13. fitted.plot() now takes xlab argument.

14. histDist() has an extra data argument now.

15. vcov.gamlss() it will give a warning if the gamlss call contains
    $ (because the function inteprFormula.default() in gamlssNonLinear() does not
    accept $'s in formulae) resulting in the failure of the exact standard errors
    obtained from the vcov() function.

16. pvc() is introduced for fitting penalised beta splines
    varying coefficient models

17. all the functions in all the package gamlss have been
    modified to take 3-parameter or  4-parameter binomial type
    response variable.

18. term.plot() now has "ylim" argument (thanks to Christian
     Kiffner)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
version 3.1.0

1. cy(): a bug is corrected

2. the packages gamlss.util is added. It has function useful
   for a GAMLSS course

3. the package gamlss.add is added. It contains new additive
   terms. Some of the functions are experimental and not tested
   rigourously.

4. new data are added to package gamlss.data

5. a bug is fixed in package gamlss.tr (related to the change
   of the first argument of the d function of the distributions
   from y to x)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
version 3.0.1

1. cy() has been modified. Now the B-splines starts from min(x)
    to max(x). It also includes an option for fitting seasonal
    effects in Time Series.

2. pb(): the option quantiles has been modified, when is TRUE
         the B-spline base is created using the function
         splineDesign().

3. IMPORTANT: All the probability "d" functions in the
   gamlss.family distribution had the fist argument y replaced
   with x to be consistent with other distribution function in R.
   This had a knock off effect in the other gamlss packages.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
version 3.0.0

The main feature of this version is the separation of the
distributions and the data from the gamlss package. To do that
the dependencies between the packages have changed. In the new
arrangement gamlss.dist and gamlss.data can be loaded
separately from the package gamlss. Loading the package gamlss
automatically will load gamlss.dist and gamlss.data.

The zero adjusted gamma (ZAGA) is added to the distributions

version 2.0.3

1. additive.fit: has been modify to allow multiple lambda.
   This should not effect old additive functions with single lambda


version 2.0.0

1. find.hyper(): is corrected from version 1.9.0

2. histDist(): "main" is added on the discrete binomial case

3. ridge() and ri() are introduced as additive term functions
   to perform ridge regression

4. pb() is introduced as additive term. The pb() is similar but
    faster than the ps() function.

5. cy() is is introduced as additive term together with its
   time series version cyts()

6. nlgamlss() and gamlssNonLinear() have changed to accommodate binomial responses (thanks to Laura Hatfield)

7. lpred() is fixed to give s.e. if the the response is Surv(). (thanks to Albert Wong)

8. WEI, WEI2, WEI3: names of variables defined at the initial
  value had been changed so they do not clash with users defined
  names. (thanks to Rob Musk)


version 1.9.0

1. prof.dev and prof.term have been modified to avoid the problem of creating two pages in pdf files

2. predict.gamlss() has been modified

         JSU JSUo LNO LO LOGNO NO NO2 NET? NBI NBII PE PE2 RG TF
         SI SEP ZIP ZAIG  have been modify to pass checkUsage()
         [Also all the distributions in package gamlss.dist].

5.   function: find.hyper() has been modified

6. make.link.gamlss() has been modified: logshift has change to logshiftto1
         while logitshifted has been taken off. The function
         make.link.gamlss() now allows the creation of a function
         defining all "own" link functions.

7. The functions VGD1, VGD2, and TGD are added.

8. BEo is added to the gamlss.family

9. histDist() : the argument freq is now corrected

10. cs() is changed to give the the correct SE's according to
          the the new version of smooth.spline

11. s() is introduced which does the same job as cs()

12. predict.gamlss() and lpred() are modified to avoid a warning
---------------------------------------------------------------------
version 1.8.0

1. "\non_function{}" is eliminated for the help files

2. ST3: cross derivatives are implemented

3. histDist(): is changed so "..." passes only to gamlss(),
              also has different arguments from the previous
              version.
4. PO() : mu.inital is changed

5. SEP.rd : is changed

6. NBI(), BB(), BEINF(): d2ldmdd is changed

8. NET, RGE, IG: small changes to comply with cens()

8. GA, NO, BCCG, BCPE, BCT, GU, RG, TF and ZAIG: the initial values for mu change to (y-mean(y))/2

9. A bug in dTF is fixed

10. PE has been modify to cope with nu go to large values

11. the glim.fit() function in gamlss() had few new stops to prevent fitting when wv or wt goes has NA's or Inf's

12 The following new distributions have been added to gamlss and gamlss.dist packages
    Power exponential type 2 (PE2)
    Skew t type 1 (ST1)
    Skew t type 2 (ST2)
    Skew t type 3 (ST3)
    Skew t type 4 (ST4)
    Skew y type 5 (ST5) the old ST3
    Skew Exponential Power type 1 (SEP1)
    Skew Exponential Power type 2 (SEP2)
    Skew Exponential Power type 3 (SEP3) old SEP
    Skew Exponential Power type 4 (SEP4)
    Generalized t (GT)
    Generalized beta type 1 (GB1)
    Generalized beta type 2 (GB2)
    Exponential generalized beta type 2 (EGB2)
 13 All the old continuous distributions have been re-checked
    using the function testContDist() and as a consequence some
    alterations have been made in some of them to improved their
    fitting performance. The user should find that fitting continuous
    distributions now is lot more robust.
  14 NO.var is renamed NO2
  15 centiles() and centiles.split(have been modified after suggestions from Steve Ellison)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
version 1.7.0

1. VGA(): The function has been modified

2. The glim.control trace has been changed to glm.trace

3. histDist : modified to accept gamlss arguments (as method) for discrete data

4. All the url have changed to www.gamlss.com

5. gamlss.bi.list became global .gamlss.bi.list

6. the residuals.gamlss() functions has changed:
           For the option "z-scores"  if weights have been used it takes the
           following action:
           if weights are integers (possibly 0,1) it assumes that frequencies are used
           and expands the residuals using "rep(obj\$residuals,w)
           if weights are not integers it does not take any action.
           As a consequence  the length of the residuals obtain from resid(obj) is not
           necessarily equal to the length(fitted(obj))
           This is done do the plot(), wp() and rqres.plot() functions working properly with
           weighted (using frequencies) analysis.
7. plot(): has been modified to cope with the new resid(obj) function

8. rqres.plot() :  has been modified to cope with the new resid(obj) function

9. wp(): has been modified to cope with the new resid(obj) function

---------------------------------------------------------------------
version 1.6.0

1. PIG : now PIG is working with CG() method. (Monday, January 8, 2007)

2. gamlss(): all references to length(y) have been removed to make the function
             able to cope with response variables that they are not vectors.

3. gamlss(): the interpretation of Surv() as response variable have changed.

4. the vcov() function has changed for names to appear (Tuesday, March 13, 2007)

5. the summary() function has changed, now the default se are calculated from the
    vcov matrix rather than the qr decomposition

6. centiles() has been modified to cope with y-variable matrix (i.e. Surv())

7. predict.gamlss() has change to work with truncated distributions and censored data
#-------------------------------------------------------------------

2. gamlss.control(): The argument save is introduced.
     save=TRUE saves on exit everything as al versions of gamlss.
     save=FALSE saves only limited information. This is useful
     when gamlss() is called repetitively with a large set of data.

3. VGD : a bug in the function is corrected

4. centile.pred : a bug is corrected (Friday, December 1, 2006 )

    have the same elements (Tim Cole pointed out the discrepancies)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
version 1.4.0

1. The make-link-gamlss has change. Now save a link-gamlss object.

2. gamlss: the formals() used within gamlss has changed to conform with the R-2.4.0
   version
---------------------------------------------------------------------

version 1.3-0

1. gamlss : mu.fix, sigma.fix, nu.fix, tau.fix are checked now if they are logical
   variables

2. centiles.pred : the code haves change to allow prediction with models with
   fixed parameters i.e. nu.fix=TRUE

3. the logLik method for gamlss is added.

4. BI and BB are modified


---------------------------------------------------------------------
version 1.2-0

1. centiles, centiles(), centiles.split(), centiles.com(), centiles.pred():
   the restriction that it should work only with continuous variable is taken off
   (the binomial case is not working yet).

2. the rqres() function is added and also is included in gamlss() in case
   trun() is called without generating first the d and p functons.

3. All distributions have the rqres() function added
   in their residuals calculation

4. NBI(), NBII() the limit to the PO() when sigma goes to zero is added to the
   d and p functions rather in the fitting function. Also in the BCT and
   TF distributions if degrees of freedom go to infinity the d function goes to BCCG
   and NO respectively

5. rqres.plot(): the restriction that it applies only to "Discrete" families is
   taken off. This allow the possibility to be used with "Mixed" families.
   For "Continuous" it will reproduce the same qqplot.

6. The non-linear add-on package gamlss.nl is created

7. The add on package gamlss.tr for truncated distributions is created

8. vcov() is introduce for gamlss objects but is not appropriate for all
   additive models. vcov(, type="se") can be used for more accurate s.e.'s

9. centiles.pred(): the function calc.cent() within  centiles.pred()
        has been changed by by Huiqi Pan.

10. predict():  type="response" it did not pick up the right function if
                the link was set i.e. IG(mu.link=identity).
                This is corrected now.

11. lpred(): the same error as above if se=T was set.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

version 1.1-0

1. A small amendment in GLIM.fit (within gamlss()). It could effect
     early iterations in the RS() algorithm.

2. NBI and NBII: if sigma goes to zero it picks up the Poisson deviance.

3. NBII: the observed second derivatives for mu and sigma (which do not always work)
   are replaced if needed by the squares of the first derivative

4. own links are introduced. Documentation can be found in the help file
   for make.link.gamlss.

5. BI "own" has been added to the options of mu.link.
   For example BI(mu.link="own") is allowed now.

6. The stepAIC() function is now renamed as stepGAIC.VR().
   The old stepGAIC() is now renamed as stepGAIC.CH().
   The new function stepGAIC() has an new argument
   "additive", which determines  whether stepGAIC.CH()
   (with additive=TRUE) or stepGAIC.VR()
   (with additive=FALSE) is used.

7. par.plot(), prof.term(): detach() is added in the end of
   the functions.

8. TF: In the calculation of G.dev.incr, if nu > 1000000, now it
       picks up the normal distribution deviance

9. BCT:  In the calculation of G.dev.incr, if tau > 1000000 it picks
         up the BCCG distribution

10. a bug is corrected in Q.stats

11. bug corrected in pp

12. the delta step in the numerical derivative within the SI have
    changed to 0.0001

13. qPIG, qSI qBB: have been corrected
